# What is Golem

Golem is a network of nodes that implement the Golem network protocol. We provide the default implementation of such a node in the form of the Golem daemon, called yagna.

The nodes in the network can act as providers or requestors. Both the requestor and the provider share the same implementation of the Golem daemon.
The diagram above shows the architecture of the network. For the sake of simplicity, it shows just one requestor and one provider.
