## Current Status
The Golem software is in Alpha testing. Users can [install the software](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/Installation) on a variety of platforms and [participate in testing](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/Testing). The first use of Golem, called _Brass Golem_, will provide CGI rendering for Blender. The [Golem project milestones](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/Roadmap) do not have set dates, Brass Golem is expected to be completed in 2018. To follow the progress of Brass Golem, you can follow our [Kanban](https://trello.com/b/YL1qZ2pZ/brass-kanban)

## Vision
With Golem, anyone will be able to rent their unused computing resources. Simultaneously, Golem will enable any user to buy computing time from other users to complete virtually any computationally demanding task. Consequently, Golem will create the first global market for idle computing power. Golem is a decentralized P2P network that uses Ethereum and smart contracts for transactions.
