Onboarding process is the same on all os-es. Instructions below were based on screenshots from Golem v 0.19.0 made on clean Windows 10 Pro installation.

1. You should be presented with two icons on your desktop: "Golem Testnet" and "Golem Mainnet". As they work separately, you will have two different setups for your testnet and mainnet application (username, password, wallet). For the purpose of this tutorial we chose Mainnet

2. The app will inform you that you are running the mainnet or testnet version. At this stage we remind you that tesnet version of the app is using tGNT and tETH that are testnet tokens, and do not hold any real world value. On the other hand all payments on the mainnet version are made with real GNT and ETH

3. You will have to scroll all the way down to be able to accept the user interaction guidelines and disclaimer You will also be able to confirm that you want to help Golem team by sending your statistics anonymously (these are traceback errors to help improve the tool, not personal data)

4. It is time to create your unique Golem password. It is crucial to remember that with Golem (and all decentralized applications) you are the only owner of your account, so there is no way of recovering your password as we donâ€™t have access to it

5. Just to be sure that you own your password you will be presented with the option of printing it or saving it as .pdf file

6. You will be asked to check if your ports 40102, 40103 and 3282 are forwarded, or if you have public IP. It is important, as without it Golem will not work. If you do not know how to forward your ports follow this [detailed instruction](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#enabling-connections).
