# Understanding Beta
  
The current version of the app available for use is our **Brass Golem Beta**. We have built a
version of Golem that is good enough for a mainnet release, but we need help from our
users to continue to test and help us improve the product from a  **usability**, **UX**, and **technical
perspective**. Beta releases still tend to have bugs, products evolve as user needs change,
and the Golem team is dedicated to putting user feedback into action. Before you download
and install the mainnet Beta of Brass please review our **Terms and Conditions and User
Interaction Guidelines** carefully.
  
As a Beta user there are some important **conditions** and **risks** that you must understand
when using this app:

* Brass Golem is now on the mainnet, using **real GNT and ETH**. This is great news, as
you can use the app to earn money and pay for computations. Users must take care
when setting prices and depositing GNT or ETH for use in the app. In the
cryptoworld, **there is no reversing transactions**. If you lose GNT because you sent it
to the wrong address or it was lost due to an unknown bug in the software, you
cannot get it back.

* The app is likely to have bugs in the UI. If you identify any strange behavior in the
app that affects your ability to use it, please reach out to us on [chat](chat.golem.network),
or contact@golem.network. Including screenshots and detailed descriptions of the
issues you experience will help us find a solution or ship a fix in a future release.

* Our app is secure, but there are always risks when altering your firewall settings and
forwarding ports to us any app. Please take the proper precautions when configuring
your machine to use Golem.

#### Risks

###### 1. Password
We do not keep a copy of your password. Remember to write it down, otherwise there will be no option to recover it. Follow those guides to learn how to [backup your wallet](Products/Brass-Beta/Usage?id=backing-up-your-golem-wallet) and how to [backup your Golem app](Products/Brass-Beta/Usage?id=backing-up-your-golem-app)

###### 2. Private key
We do not have access to your private key. Remember to include it in your backup otherwise there will be no option to recover it. Follow those guides to learn how to [backup your wallet](Products/Brass-Beta/Usage?id=backing-up-your-golem-wallet)  and how to [backup your Golem app](Products/Brass-Beta/Usage?id=backing-up-your-golem-app)

###### 3. Secure your funds
You should **not keep large amounts of GNT and ETH** in the beta version of the software, it should be considered as a **hot wallet**.

###### 4. Rewards for computation
Golem is still in the early stages of building a network, so it may happen that as a Provider you will not get tasks to compute, and therefore you will not earn tokens for sharing your resources.

###### 5. Failed payments
We are preparing Concents to increase fairness inside the network, for now you are not guaranteed to get payments for work done in Beta. 

###### 6. Awaiting for payments
We use **batch transactions to minimize the cost of transactions**, so if you use Golem as a Provider **you may wait** for transfers for a maximum of **24h**.

###### 7. Update the app
You may experience some issues if you have not updated your Golem to the newest version, including getting and sending tasks to the network.

###### 8. Reputation
If you set reputation too high for interactions inside the network in your Node, or if your Node has to low reputation in the network you may not get tasks to compute and your tasks may not be computed.

###### 9. Blacklist
If your Node was added to the blacklist you may not get tasks to compute.

###### 10. Settings
You may experience some issues if, as a Provider, you set up too high a price for the incoming Tasks, or as a Requestor if you set a too low price for your Tasks.
You may also experience some issues if your Node does not have enough CPU and RAM for incoming Tasks.
If you are rendering heavy tasks on Golem please make sure that you share/provide Golem with RAM (more than 8GB may be needed) to properly verify a task.
